## Using the App

I recommend placing the app in your Dock for convienence.

1. Create your project in PaintCode like usual.
2. Copy the code output to your clipboard.
3. Click on PaintMotion.app in the Dock.
4. Paste the converted code into your RubyMotion project.

## WARNING

This is a crude Automator app that runs a Ruby script for with a big ugly set of regular expressions. I have no idea what works and what doesn't, but it should at least convert a very large chunk of your code.
